Rationale for LessMoney
=======================

Once upon a time, I emptied my wallet. Only with money in my wallet would I
henceforth buy food. I defined some simple rules by which I put money back in
my wallet. I was honest with myself, and so this arrangement worked miracles
on my self-motivation and discipline. So I lived happily ever after.
